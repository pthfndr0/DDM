More urgently, Alexander agreed to other liberalizations of Russian society. Among these were the creation of representative bodies called zemstva, in effect a form of local government in villages and provinces, given authority to dispense education, charitable relief and other services.

While ostensibly affirming the Finns' rights in purely local matters, the manifesto asserted the authority of the state in any and all matters which could be considered to "come within the scope of the general legislation of the empire". The main policies enacted were:\nThe conscription law, incorporating the Finnish army into the imperial army.\nThe Language Manifesto of $YEAR$ which made Russian the language of administration of Finland.\nThe Orthodox Russian Church was the church of state, including, for example, criminalizing the act of subjecting a follower of the Orthodox church to a Lutheran church service.\nThe Manifesto of $YEAR$ which asserted the imperial government's right to rule Finland without the consent of local legislative bodies, including press censorship and restrictions of Russian currency and stamps as the only ones allowed.\nOur Finnish subjects will surely not like this and they might try to resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tasmania_penal_colony_desc;In 1803 the island south of Australia was colonized by the British as a penal colony with the name Van Diemen's Land, and became part of the British colony of New South Wales. Male convicts served their sentences as assigned labor to free settlers or in gangs assigned to public works. Only the most difficult convicts (mostly re-offenders) were sent to the Tasman Peninsula prison known as Port Arthur. Female convicts were assigned as servants in free settler households or sent to a female factory (women's workhouse prison). There were five female factories in Van Diemen's Land. Convicts completing their sentences or earning their ticket-of-leave often promptly left Van Diemen's Land. Many settled in the new free colony of Victoria, to the dismay of the free settlers in towns such as Melbourne.\n\nWe can abolish the penal colony and convert the island to a regular colony.

embrace_the_boer_desc;The Dutch East Indies company rule in South Africa was tyrannical: they closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in its own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded from them a large part of their produce, and harassed them with other exactions tending to discourage industry and enterprise. The effect of this tyranny was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and thus trekking began. The colony changed hands but many of the Boer farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with the Dutch East India Company, though their ground of complaint was not the same.

east_africa_company_title;The German East Africa Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
east_africa_company_desc;The Society for German Colonization has been attempting to colonize the Zanzibar coast for several years now, having formed the German East Africa company and signed several treaties with Swahili tribes. It now seems they are facing difficulty with rebellions and have asked us to step in. The Sultan of Zanzibar will doubtlessly object if we do, as he claims authority over the coast -- even if his actual authority is minimal -- but so what if he does? This may be an interesting opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
luderitz_expedition_title;Found the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ South West Africa Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
luderitz_expedition_desc;First discovered in 1487 by the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias, the small coastal area known as Angra Pequena was made into a trading station by German trader Adolf Lüderitz in 1883. He concluded treaties with the neighboring chiefs, buying large tracts of land for a total sum of 560 pounds sterlings and 260 rifles. The new land was then named "Lüderitzland". Lüderitz has plans to send expeditions further north, in the place the natives call Otjozondjii, known in German as Swakopmund but under the belief that a Great Power was about to claim the area as a protectorate, Lüderitz stalled his plans and asked for the protection of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government in $YEAR$. Extending our protection to him and hoisting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag in Lüderitzbucht, declaring these lands "protection areas" can start the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ South West Africa Colony, though we risk some attrition with other Great Powers..;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

german_west_africa_desc;The first German trading post in the Duala area on the Kamerun River delta was established in 1868 by the Hamburg trading company C. Woermann. By 1884, Adolph Woermann, representing all West African companies as their spokesman, petitioned the imperial foreign office for "protection" by the German Empire. \n\n The German explorer, medical doctor, imperial consul and commissioner for West Africa Gustav Nachtigal was the driving force toward the colony’s establishment. By then well over a dozen German companies, based in Hamburg and Bremen, conducted their trading and plantation activities in Kamerun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

cologne_cathedral_desc;With the 19th century romantic enthusiasm for the Middle Ages, and spurred on by the lucky discovery of the original plan for the façade, it was decided, with the commitment of the Court, to complete the cathedral. It was achieved by civic effort. In 1840, the burghers of Cologne petitioned the king for the foundation of a association regarding the buidling of the Cologne cathedral. After the permission and promised financial help, the Central-Dombauverein was founded in 1842. The association raised two-thirds of the enormous costs (over 1 billion US-Dollar in today's money), while the state supplied the remaining third.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

begin_pax_britannica_title;Pax Britannica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
begin_pax_britannica_desc;Latin for 'British Peace'\n\n The Napoleonic Wars left Great Britain as the most powerful naval country in the world, with no meaningful rivals. The country's economic and strategic strength was buttressed by the fleet, localized military action was a staple of the not-entirely-peaceful 'Pax Britannica'. In addition, the threat of naval force was a significant factor in diplomacy. \n\nDuring the late 19th century, Britain's primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive. The sea routes to the colonies, especially those linking Britain to India were vital. \n\nÂ§RNOTE: This will cause Britain to reject all alliances with great powers unless it is threatened by another rising great power.Â§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
